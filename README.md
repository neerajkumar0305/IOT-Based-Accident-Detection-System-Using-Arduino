# IOT-Based-Accident-Detection-System-Using-Arduino
The incidence of road accidents has increased as technology and motor vehicle manufacture have advanced. Our concept would assist in detecting an accident and determining its location, which would then be communicated to the rescue team and the rider's emergency contacts.

Step 1: Project Overview

Begin by providing an overview of the project, explaining that it aims to create a road accident detection system. This system will utilize a Bluetooth-controlled car, Arduino coding, alcohol sensor, GPS module, GSM module, LED display, accelorometer and a buzzer.


Step 2: Hardware Setup

Detail the hardware components required for the project, including the Bluetooth-controlled car, Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno), alcohol sensor, GPS module, GSM module, LED display, buzzer, accelorometer and a reset button. Explain how these components will be connected and integrated to form the road accident detection system.


Step 3: Bluetooth Control Implementation

Describe the implementation of the Bluetooth control system using Arduino coding. Explain how the Arduino board will receive commands from a serial Bluetooth application on a smartphone. Define the commands for various car movements, such as forward (F), backward (B), left (L), and right (R). Elaborate on the coding logic that will interpret the received commands and control the car accordingly.


Step 4: Alcohol Sensor Integration

Explain the integration of the alcohol sensor into the system. Specify the threshold value (e.g., 500) above which the alcohol level is considered dangerous. Describe how the Arduino board will read the alcohol sensor's data and display it on the LED display. Explain the coding logic that will compare the alcohol sensor readings with the threshold value and initiate a car stop command if the value exceeds the threshold.


Step 5: GPS Module Integration

Detail the integration of the GPS module into the system. Explain how the GPS module will retrieve location coordinates. Describe how the Arduino board will communicate with the GPS module and retrieve the coordinates. Explain the coding logic that will extract the location coordinates from the GPS module's output.


Step 6: GSM Module Integration

Elaborate on the integration of the GSM module into the system. Explain how the GSM module will be used to send location coordinates in case of an accident. Describe how the Arduino board will communicate with the GSM module and provide the necessary data. Explain the coding logic that will trigger the GSM module to send location coordinates when an accident occurs, provided that the reset button is not pressed.


Step 7: Accident Detection and Alert

Explain the accident detection mechanism using the accelorometer sensor. Describe the coding logic that will continuously monitor the readings. If the readings exceed the specified threshold (e.g., 350), an accident will be detected. Once an accident is detected, the coding logic will activate the buzzer for a duration of 10 seconds to alert nearby individuals.


Step 8: Reset Button Functionality

Describe the functionality of the reset button. Explain how pressing the reset button within the specified time after an accident will prevent the transmission of location coordinates. However, if the reset button is not pressed within the allotted time, the Arduino board will trigger the GSM module to send the location coordinates.



Step 9: Summarize the project, highlighting the successful implementation of a road accident detection system.
